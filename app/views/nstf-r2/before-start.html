          Moving through the form
        </h3>

        <p>
          This form is split into sections based on how it will be assessed.
        </p>
        <p>
          You do not have to complete it in order, or all at once.
        </p>
        <!-- <p>You can preview the <a href="../cof-r3-all-questions">full list of application questions</a>.</p> -->
        <p>
          When you have written something in every field in a section, the section will be marked as complete. You can still change your responses in sections that are marked as complete.
        </p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">

          Your work will not save automatically. To make sure you do not lose anything, select <strong> Save and continue</strong> regularly, and always before you go back or close your internet browser window.        </p>
        <p>
          If you need to edit or revisit any sections, use the browser back button.
        </p>
        <p>You can edit your responses as many times as you like before you submit.</p>
      </p>
