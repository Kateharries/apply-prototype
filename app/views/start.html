        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How to complete your application</h2>
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What we’ll ask you for</h3>
        <p>You can preview the <a href="#" class="govuk-link">full list of application questions</a>.</p>
        <p>We’ll also ask you to upload a business plan to support the answers you’ve given us in the management case section.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Moving through the form</h3>
        <p>The form is split into sections based on how it will be assessed.</p>
        <p>You do not have to complete it in order, or all at once.</p>
        <p>When you have written something in a field in every section, the section will be marked as complete. You can still change your responses in sections that are marked as complete.</p>


        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Saving progress and making changes</h3>
        <p>Your work will not save automatically. To make sure you do not lose anything, select Save and continue regularly, and always before you go back or close your internet browser window.</p>
        <p>If you need to edit or revisit any sections, use the browser back button.</p>
        <p>You can edit your responses as many times as you like before you submit.</p>


        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Submitting your application</h3>
        <p>When you have completed all sections, you’ll be able to submit your application.</p>
        <p>Once you have submitted your application, you’ll not be able to edit, add or change any section.</p>
